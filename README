This is KeySafe!
================

None of the password keepers I have tried really suited me, and after reading
about Password Minder[1] I decided to write my own little utility.

The most useful thing about KeySafe is the separation between using and
configuring. All other tools I've tried combine the two in onto one program,
and the end result is a cluttered program that isn't small enough to pop up
every time I need a password.

License

The code for KeySafe is released under GPL version 2. A copy of the full

Why implementing it in Python?
==============================

Python is fast and easy. You're looking at code that took less than a day's
work to write (and it might show).

The security is somewhat lower because of it, but I've tried keeping it in
mind when designing the tool. The window of opportunity is kept small by only
asking for the master password at the very end. I can be persuaded rewriting
it in a more primitive language if someone points out serious security
problems with the current implementation.

Installation
============

The installation is somewhat unfriendly. You have been warned!

The reason for this is that the GUI is made using Glade and the code used to
load it isn't very flexible. I'm also hesitant making it more flexible by
using Python code. I'd much rather see distutils support rewriting similar to
what Autoconf does. For now it's left as an exercise for packagers and
daredevils installing from source.

Left to do
==========

The configuration tool is not friendly at all. It suffices for its purpose but
its GUI could do with an overhaul.

The store itself uses cryptography to store the passwords
