What format should the passwords be stored in?
 
 I want to keep the password in memory as short a time as possible. AFAIK I
 can't lock pages in python.

 I want to be able to tell if the given KSPwd was the correct one. I.e. part
 of the password storage must contain a known part:
  
  Known string (known plain text problem?)
  Two that are the same (can be a randomized byte that's repeated)

 The length of the stored password should have no relation to the length of
 the user password. I.e. add some padding.

  Should the padding be randomized?

Would it be useful from the command line?

 I doubt it! How do I copy the password into the other command line too?

vim: set ft=text:
